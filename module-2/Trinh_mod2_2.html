                here I am a Vietnamese American.</span> I am also Catholic so that isn't even my full name. My full Vietnamese

                Dang Khoa is by middle name and Trinh is my last name.

            In my current household we have 4 family memebers. My Father Hung, my mother Dianner and older sister Beatrice.
            We also have a pet dog named Sparky. He is an Austrilian Sheperd and we have had him for nearly 3 years. Funny fact 
            is I don't think he is well trained and I partly blame my suster for spoiling him, because it is "her dog".
        </p>
        <p>
            I saw that Sparky is her dog because my sister and I split the cost to get him, but she refused to add me to the birth certificate. 
            Also I didn't get much of a choice in naming the dog. I would have gone for something cooler and or seen in anime. I would have named 
            him Sora or Riku or something much cooler than Sparky
        </p>
        <p>
            But oh wells, choices were made and I just had to live with it. At the end of the day I still love that dog. I do think he is extremely 
            spoiled and would have trained him differently myself. However you know the saying "too many chefs in the kitchen ruin the soup."
            Yeah I didn't want to confuse him too much with the amount of different lessons teaching him. So I folded and allowed my father and sister 
            to train him the way they wanted.
